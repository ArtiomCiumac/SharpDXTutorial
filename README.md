Tutorial series for SharpDX Toolkit
===============

This project contains all code used in [tutorial](http://devplanet.blogspot.com/) series for [SharpDX Toolkit](http://sharpdx.org/).

Note that this repository does not contain any SharpDX assemblies, you will need to either download them from the official site (latest dev package) or to build them from [source](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX).

The process of setting up the development environment is explained in the [first tutorial](http://devplanet.blogspot.com/2014/02/sharpdx-toolkit-tutorial-1-introduction.html).
